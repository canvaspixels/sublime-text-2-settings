All my sublime text 2 settings

To install my settings (in mac) go to the Sublime Text Packages folder in terminal and move your User folder out the way.

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
    mv User UserOld

Then clone this repo:

    git clone https://github.com/canvaspixels/sublime-settings.git User
